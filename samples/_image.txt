* Blogger Operator [resizeImage]
	- imageURL can be from blogger expression or Image URL listed on supported image url above. 
	If used with Image URL as value, it must be wrapped with Double Quote'
	- newSize is the new size based on width
	- "Ratio" wrapped with double quote. Is the integer ratio of the image 
	"1:1" or "4:3" or "16:9" or "1200:630", etc. If this ratio is present, 
	the image will be cropped. The right hand ratio cannot be higher 
	than the left hand such as "320:640".

URL of the image is wrapped with double quotes, 
The result of operation is, image will be resized 
to 640px width and cropped to 640x240px.

Blogger Operator [sourceSet]
sourceSet is operator used in srcset attribute, 
is HTML attribute which allows us to tell the 
Browser to specify different kind of images for different screen-sizes 
or orientation or display-types based on different condition.

<img> tag can't work alone with srcset attribute. 
we still need the src attribute. In short, 
we have two attribute in single <img> tag, src and srcset.

The operator sourceSet syntax almost like the operator resizeImage, 
the different is on the newSize part. 
In this part we set multiple image width dimension separated by comma.

EXAMPLE WITH EXPRESSION

<img expr:src='data:post.featuredImage' expr:srcset='sourceSet(data:post.featuredImage, [256,512,945,1684])'/>

EXAMPLE WITH IMAGE URL

<img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ETVZuT6pvuEx7Pp8D5gIox' 
expr:srcset='sourceSet("https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ETVZuT6pvuEx7Pp8D5gIox", [256, 512, 945, 1684])'/>
